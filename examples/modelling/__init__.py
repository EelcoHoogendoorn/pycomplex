"""
This submodule contains some scripts not particularly strongly related to the overall pycomplex project,
but they provide an illustration of using some of the tools in pycomplex to perform geometric modelling tasks,
as I have encountered them and found pycomplex useful over the past years, relative to traditional CAD/CAM tools,
or programmable frameworks like OpenSCAD.
Not that pycomplex is intended to be a feature complete competitor to any such framework,
but I often find the programmability and extensibility of this environment the right tool for the job.
