"""Electrostatic equations

Particularly interested here if we can see something about surface charge and its interactions,
by looking carefully at the boundary terms

Physics:
    div E = rho     divergence is charge density
    curl E = 0      static electric field is irrotational

It is tempting to model this as a potential problem straight away;
E = grad V
But we will hold off with that for a little, for the sake of generality

Or in DEC:
    dE = rho
    Î´E = 0
With E a 1-form on a 2d manifold, and a 1-form on a 3d manifold

In the 2d case, the equations thus formed are truly indistinguishable from the magnetostatic case!
In the 3d case
