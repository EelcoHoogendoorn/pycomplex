"""Model a permanent magnet

Physics:
    div B = 0
    curl H = J
    B = mu H

Or in DEC:
    dB = 0      magnetic flux is divergence-free
    Î´H = J      magnetic flux is irrotational, where no current is present

With B a 1-form on a 2d manifold, or a 2-form on a 3d manifold


AMG works poorly here; worse than pure minres. for scalar laplace we get factor two gain, here factor two loss
note that the algebraic properties of the normal equations here are a pretty standard vector laplace-beltrami;
not clear why it should perform any worse than seismic simulation?
it doesnt; appears amg isnt as effective for vectorial fields generally?
seems like it; when adding anisotropy, amg becomes no faster; but less stable!
this is in contrast to seismic, where eigen decomposition becomes more stable with amg. what gives?


normal-equations to solve is essentially a vector-laplacian;
how is it different from elasto-statics? there, neither rotation nor compression is zero.
the fact that the solution are divergence and rotation free is a consequence of
left-multiplication of rhs?
normal-equation rhs is projected on the subspace of solenoidal and irrotational fields

note that we could make the mesh spacing variable to efficiently simulate open field at infinity
